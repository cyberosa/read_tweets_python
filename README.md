# Content
This repository provides two different files:
* collect_tweets.py
* cleaning_tweets.ipynb

The python file to collect the tweets might take up to 20 min to collect 150000 tweets. You can change the volume size but keep in mind that disconnections are common and it will take longer than you expect.

The jupyter notebook contains the code to clean the tweets, however I added it in this format because it is always a good practice to explore a bit the data you have in your hands and double check every transformation before automating anything.

Feel free to add any contributions. Part of the collect_tweets code was taken from somewhere but I dont find the reference anymore.

# Prerequisites
You might need to have installed in your machine all the needed Python libraries. Besides you need to request access to the Twitter API from your Twitter account. See more details in https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps
The process of getting the credentials to access Twitter data might take several days because it needs approval from Twitter.
